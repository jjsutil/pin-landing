## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Astro implementation of the approved v8 landing prototype
  (`design/prototype/pin-landing-v8.html`): ES at `/`, EN at `/en/` via Astro
  i18n routing, verbatim ES/EN copy, exact color tokens for both themes, system
  font stacks, staggered reveals, animated figures, interactive viewer,
  simulated typing, browser-validated forms with on-screen confirmation (no
  backend), full accessibility from the prototype. Theme toggle persists in
  localStorage (the one authorized improvement). Zero external requests.
- Visual evidence in `design/evidence/`: hero and form, light and dark, ES and EN,
  plus full-page mobile captures (iPhone 13 viewport, ES/EN) — no horizontal
  overflow in any language/theme combination.

### Fixed (owner QA, 2026-07-30)

- Missing space between the two thesis headline spans ("…el modelo. La apunta.").
- Stray trailing caret in the ask bar: the caret now hides once the third phrase
  settles (deliberate delta vs the v8 prototype, requested in QA).
