# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed (owner decision via direction, 2026-07-30)

- Final footer tagline, in two levels: head "A la altura de su oficio." /
  "Built to the standard of your craft." (foot-tag style) plus a muted sub-line
  closing with the emphasized seal "Todo leído, todo citado." / "Everything
  read, everything cited." Replaces "El sistema operativo del trabajo legal en
  la era de la IA." / "The operating system of legal work in the AI era."
- Section order is now Hero → Ask → Figures → Thesis → Quotes → Form (was
  Hero → Figures → Quotes → Thesis → Ask → Form): asking an AI is an already
  normalized gesture, so the ask bar moves up as a familiarity hook; Figures
  next to Thesis pairs claim with mechanism ("100% cited" → "the model does not
  write the citation, it points at it"); Quotes close the argument and their
  verdict feeds straight into the offer.
- The fidelity contract advanced to v9 in place
  (`design/prototype/pin-landing-v8.html`): the same two changes, recorded in a
  header comment. The ask-bar caret in the prototype is untouched (pending
  owner confirmation).
- Footer and full-page order evidence refreshed in `design/evidence/`
  (light/dark × ES/EN).

### Added

- Astro implementation of the approved v8 landing prototype
  (`design/prototype/pin-landing-v8.html`): ES at `/`, EN at `/en/` via Astro
  i18n routing, verbatim ES/EN copy, exact color tokens for both themes, system
  font stacks, staggered reveals, animated figures, interactive viewer,
  simulated typing, browser-validated forms with on-screen confirmation (no
  backend), full accessibility from the prototype. Theme toggle persists in
  localStorage (the one authorized improvement). Zero external requests.
- Visual evidence in `design/evidence/`: hero and form, light and dark, ES and EN,
  plus full-page mobile captures (iPhone 13 viewport, ES/EN) — no horizontal
  overflow in any language/theme combination.

### Fixed (owner QA, 2026-07-30)

- Missing space between the two thesis headline spans ("…el modelo. La apunta.").
- Stray trailing caret in the ask bar: the caret now hides once the third phrase
  settles (deliberate delta vs the v8 prototype, requested in QA).
